# About DevQandA

The purpose of this project is for me to demonstrate my skills, coding style, and perhaps most importantly, my work process, to a potential employer and their development team, to help them determine whether or not I would be a good fit for their team and its needs.


# The Assignment

### User Story

As a developer looking for a job I would like an application that answers common questions I'm asked by hiring managers.

### Acceptance Criteria

 - The hiring manager should be able to obtain answers to the following questions about you:

   - What is your favorite programming language, and why?
   - Tabs or spaces, and why?
   - Do you have a Stack Overflow account?
   - What does JSON stand for?

 - There should be at least one easter-egg feature built into the application which should be accessible to the hiring manager, but they wouldn't know about it unless they read the source code.


# To Run
