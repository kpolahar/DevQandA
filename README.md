# About DevQandA

The purpose of this project is for me to demonstrate my skills, coding style, and perhaps most importantly, my work process, to a potential employer and their development team, to help them determine whether or not I would be a good fit for their team and its needs.


# The Assignment

### User Story

As a developer looking for a job I would like an application that answers common questions I'm asked by hiring managers.

### Acceptance Criteria

 - The hiring manager should be able to obtain answers to the following questions about you:

   - What is your favorite programming language, and why?
   - Tabs or spaces, and why?
   - Do you have a Stack Overflow account?
   - What does JSON stand for?

 - There should be at least one easter-egg feature built into the application which should be accessible to the hiring manager, but they wouldn't know about it unless they read the source code.


# To Run

This project is not yet complete, but you are welcome to take a look at the project files in the meantime.
I will do my best to post complete instructions on how to run the project even if you do not already have the prerequisites installed as soon as the project is fully functional. ^_^
